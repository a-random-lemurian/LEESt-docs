			The <b>Counter-Sayari Strike Force</b> is a militia organization primarily active in the Illumina Regions.Â It is most known for it's continued brazen attacks against the Sayari Plushie Authority's trade and war fleets. As a result of these attacks, for the past 30-90 years, there has been a war between the SPA and the CSSF. The CSSF is led by a person known to the SPA as "Yuyuko Saigyouji", but it is entirely possible that it is just a codename or a metaphor for a group of leaders.

		<p class="encyclopedia">
			Whatever it is, the CSSF's headquarters are unknown. It is not even known if they have one, or if they are a decentralized organization operating from several small bases across the Illumina Regions.
