      The <b>Sayari Plushie Authority</b>, <b>SPA</b> for short, is a quasi-national organization operating in the Illumina Regions. Headquartered on <a href="wiki/khoramelia.html">Khoramelia</a>, it possesses the 2nd largest navy behind the Republic. It primarily funds it's operations through the sale of Sayari plushies that have come in many different sizes. Outside of the Illumina Regions, it is not active. A rival organization known as the <a href="wiki/cssf.html">Counter-Sayari Strike Force</a> has actively opposed it's operations and continue to attack SPA ships to this day in what is now known as the Plushie Wars.

      Sayari herself is a Hai ambassador who visited the Republic sometime in the 2900s, whose existence was kept secret by the Republic for purposes still unknown. The Authority continues to sell Sayari plushies despite this, marketing it as a female character from an old type of animation called "anime" originating in the region of Earth known as "Japan". Very few people are aware of the true nature of Sayari, except for the CSSF.
