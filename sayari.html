			<p class="encyclopedia">
      			The <b>Sayari Plushie Authority</b>, <b>SPA</b> for short, is a quasi-national organization operating in the Illumina Regions. Headquartered on <a href="wiki/khoramelia.html">Khoramelia</a>, it possesses the 2nd largest navy behind the Republic. It primarily funds it's operations through the sale of Sayari plushies that have come in many different sizes. Outside of the Illumina Regions, it is not active. A rival organization known as the <a href="wiki/cssf.html">Counter-Sayari Strike Force</a> has actively opposed it's operations and continue to attack SPA ships to this day in what is now known as the Plushie Wars. Sayari herself is a Hai ambassador who visited the Republic sometime in the 2900s, whose existence was kept secret by the Republic for purposes still unknown. The Authority continues to sell Sayari plushies despite this, marketing it as a female character from an old type of movie/printed material called "anime" and "manga" respectively originating in the region of Earth known as "Japan". Very few people are aware of the true nature of Sayari, except for the CSSF.

				Having split off from an old group dedicated to the preservation of media from the ancient 21st century, the Sayari Plushie Authority immediately pivoted towards experimenting with anime and finding ways to improve and build upon the concept. In 2996, the CSSF attacked the Sayari Plushie Authority for the first time in the Tania Australis system. Since then, the Republic's territories in the Illumina Regions have been caught in the crossfire. The Republic is afraid to intervene in the conflict however, as the SPA has the capability to significantly disrupt the Republic economically and militarily due to their doctrine of numerical superiority combined with strategically placing Emerald Swords on the brink of destruction into large clusters of CSSF ships to significantly damage them or outright destroy them with the resulting explosion.
    		</p>

				The Sayari Plushie Authority has a limited array of nuclear weapons, however none have been significant or powerful enough to effectively combat CSSF ships or attract the attention of the Republic. Currently, it is believed that there are no plans to further develop nuclear weapons. This aside, the Sayari Plushie Authority is well-known amongst ship enthusiasts and shipyards due to their copious use of a ship called the "Kar Ik Vot 349". To certain people, it is something they reverse-engineered from the Kor Mereti, but to the common man and woman, either they believe it to be an original human design, or are too busy to care.
			</p>
			<h1 class="encyclopedia-header-nosize">History</h1>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				The roots of the Sayari Plushie Authority are believed to have begun in the 2300s, after the formation of the <a href="wiki/animeorg.html">Anime Organization</a> on Earth from a network of archaeologists, archivists, and enthusiasts. The Anime Organization's main task was the preservation of an early-21st century form of animated 2D movies called "anime". In the late 2800s, infighting amongst the Anime Organization grew ever larger, and a group of high-ranking archivists in the organization split off and formed the Sayari Plushie Authority after the Anime Organization discovered the Hai near northeastern Human space.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				Seeing an opportunity to support the Sayari Plushie Authority financially, in 2873, the Sayari Plushie Authority released it's first lineup of plushies of a squirrel-like character named Sayari. Marketed as a character from an anime released in the early 21st century, plushies of her were first sold on Earth before merchants and resellers brought them to Geminus, Capella, New Boston, Glaze, and many more.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				For most of it's history, the SPA was able to manufacture and distribute it's plushies in peace until October 23, 2996, when the first merchant convoy of the SPA was destroyed by hostile parties other than pirates. This brazen organization, fierce in it's attacks, made itself known as the Counter-Sayari Strike Force. Claiming that it is led by a woman known only as "Yuyuko Saigyouji", it immediately flooded the Illumina Regions with large numbers of ships, which continually attacked shipments of Sayari plushies.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				The resulting conflict became known as the Illumina Wars. Due to the fearsome power of both sides, the Republic nor the Syndicate dared to intervene in the war, but CSSF and SPA fleets were blocked from entering Republic and Syndicate space until 3009, when the war had considerably calmed down. Even in the 3010s, the conflict still rages on in the Illumina Regions, albeit with a much lower intensity than what one could expect in 3005.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				Currently, it is unknown if the CSSF has a base, or if they even have one. Attempts to investigate have so far turned up to be unsuccessful.
			</p>
			<h1 class="encyclopedia-header-nosize">Military</h1>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				The military of the SPA operates on a scale large enough to effectively cripple the Republic at large-scale. So far, they have not executed any military actions against the Republic so far, due to their obviously higher priority target, the CSSF. The navy of the Authority is known as the Sayari Protection Fleet and the planetside army the Sayari Defense Force. SPA doctrine emphasizes the use of overwhelming numbers to overwhelm it's enemies rather quickly, as displayed in it's notoriously large fleets often exceeding 20 or more ships.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				The two main ships used by the SPA are the Falcon and the Kar Ik Vot 349, which act as a destroyer and battleship respectively. It's main counterpart, the CSSF, uses the same ships but have deployed Leviathans and Firebirds on more than one occasion. Falcons are however highly vulnerable to destruction especially in Orbona, where the CSSF employs a strategy of ramming Emerald Swords on the brink of destruction into SPA fleets in the hopes that the resulting explosion will destroy if not significantly cripple that fleet's capabilities.
			</p>
			<p class="encyclopedia">
				In the Illumina Regions, the SPA controls 4 planets, which are Khoramelia, Arlok, Rodoluki, and Mindai. These planets, with the exception of Arlok, which requires passage through a Republic system to arrive from the three main systems. Arlok also serves as a naval base for the SPA to support fleets fighting off CSSF fleets in the Orbona system.
