			<p class="encyclopedia">
      			The <b>Sayari Plushie Authority</b>, <b>SPA</b> for short, is a quasi-national organization operating in the Illumina Regions. Headquartered on <a href="wiki/khoramelia.html">Khoramelia</a>, it possesses the 2nd largest navy behind the Republic. It primarily funds it's operations through the sale of Sayari plushies that have come in many different sizes. Outside of the Illumina Regions, it is not active. A rival organization known as the <a href="wiki/cssf.html">Counter-Sayari Strike Force</a> has actively opposed it's operations and continue to attack SPA ships to this day in what is now known as the Plushie Wars. Sayari herself is a Hai ambassador who visited the Republic sometime in the 2900s, whose existence was kept secret by the Republic for purposes still unknown. The Authority continues to sell Sayari plushies despite this, marketing it as a female character from an old type of animation called "anime" originating in the region of Earth known as "Japan". Very few people are aware of the true nature of Sayari, except for the CSSF.

				Having split off from an old group dedicated to the preservation of media from the ancient 21st century, the Sayari Plushie Authority immediately pivoted towards experimenting with anime and finding ways to improve and build upon the concept. In 2996, the CSSF attacked the Sayari Plushie Authority for the first time in the Tania Australis system. Since then, the Republic's territories in the Illumina Regions have been caught in the crossfire. The Republic is afraid to intervene in the conflict however, as the SPA has the capability to significantly disrupt the Republic economically and militarily due to their doctrine of numerical superiority combined with strategically placing Emerald Swords on the brink of destruction into large clusters of CSSF ships to significantly damage them or outright destroy them with the resulting explosion.

				The Sayari Plushie Authority has a limited array of nuclear weapons, however none have been significant or powerful enough to effectively combat CSSF ships or attract the attention of the Republic. Currently, it is believed that there are no plans to further develop nuclear weapons.
