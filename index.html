		<h2>A plugin for Endless Sky</h2>

			<p>The <b>Sayari Plushie Authority</b> has risen in the Illumina Regions and the Pelitol Cluster, two new
				exciting region of human space. Their mission is to bring joy to the galaxy through plushies of Sayari,
				the Hai ambassador to the Wanderers. Unfortunately, not everybody agrees with the Sayari Plushie
				Authority. The <b>Counter-Sayari Strike Force</b>, or the CSSF, has risen up against the SPA, launching
				raids on colonies and attacking ships.</p>
			<p>The Republic is hopeless against both sides, however. The Sayari Plushie Authority has more than enough
				naval firepower to take on the Republic, though most of it is allocated to fending off the slightly less
				powerful but still formidale CSSF. To this end, the Republic minds its business and their ships are
				treated as neutral in the conflict.</p>
			<p>There's no great storyline and Lemuria probably doesn't have the resources (like time, work ethic, and
				the will to do so) to try, but there are a few small side missions, data transports, and ways to make
				money and easily access alien technologies from the SPA's vast stockpiles.</p>

			<h2>Amidala</h2>
			<p>The Sayari Plushie Authority needed firepower, so they turned to, and eventually modified the Kar Ik Vot
				349 to satisfy this need. Slightly bulkier than the baseline KIV, it can hold its own against a small
				fleet of CSSF ships and keep the fight going long enough for reinforcements to arrive.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature-item">
			<img src="/image/cssf.png" style="float: right;" height="200px">
			<h2>Two giants at war</h2>
			<p>The Illumina Regions is a battleground for the Sayari Plushie Authority and the Counter-Sayari Strike
				Force. The CSSF has set up shop on the other side of a wormhole somewhere, from which they coordinate
				their attacks on the Sayari Plushie Authority. What secrets are they hiding in there?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature-item">
			<img src="/image/pelitol-map.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;" height="200px">
			<h2>Pelitol Cluster</h2>
			<p>At the very edge of human space, past the Illumina Regions, was the Pelitol Cluster. The entire cluster
				has yet to be settled, but the Republic and the Sayari Plushie Authority have both set up camp in the
				cluster. To the south exists the still-unsettled Starium Cluster, where settlers still have the chance
				to leave behind a completely new legacy of their own.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="feature-item">
			<img src="/image/ann-arbor.jpg" style="float: right;" height="200px">
			<h2>Plenty of planets</h2>
			<p>On every planet LEEST brings, there is either a large bustling settlement, a nature reserve, a couple
				small villages, or a massive plushie manufacturing factory. Looking up into the skies, it's either a
				clear night of stars or one of explosions and ship fragments, the remnant of a CSSF-led attack on SPA
				shipping.</p>
